Copy the EvolutionaryTrees folder into your "go/src" directory.

You will also need to download some matrices that we computed for SARS-CoV-2 genomes and will need to use to produce plots. These matrices can be found on Canvas. Place the resulting "Matrices" folder within "go/src/EvolutionaryTrees".
